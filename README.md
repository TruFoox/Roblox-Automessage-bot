This bot allows you to scrape a group's members for people who have their DMs open on Roblox and then send them all a custom message

This was originally made for my own usage, but ive since retired it. Now, im putting the code here for anyone to use
However, because I was not planning on giving this code to anyone else, the code contains no comments


I may add a proper README with instructions in the future

For now:

Put all your info in the config

Put your discord ID into whitelistedusers.json

Put cookies into cookies.txt (each on a new line)

Put proxies into proxies.txt and spamProxies.txt (each on a new line) 

Open userScraper to scrape a group for users to send messages to

Open run.py to send messages AFTER you run the userscraper

MAKE SURE THE GROUP YOU SCRAPE IS VERY LARGE. THIS BOT CAN ONLY SEND MESSAGES TO PEOPLE WITH "Who can message me?" SET TO "Everyone" IN THEIR SETTINGS



*** DM ME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ***
